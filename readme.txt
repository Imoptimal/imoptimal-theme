== Description ==
Simplistic theme, with an option (available inside of admin menu, at Appearance/Customize) to enable users to build their whole website either through: a) Widgets - best if used with Pagebuilder by Siteorigin plugin, and its widgets bundle; b) Elementor - most popular website builder plugin. Intended for technically advanced users that build their own websites or websites for others, as a tool to make this process more efficient. IMPORTANT: Both widget and elementor option should be used to build a website through pages (not posts).
