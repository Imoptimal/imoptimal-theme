Starter theme, with an option to enable users to build their whole website with widgets (option available inside of admin menu, at Appearance/Customize). Best if used with Pagebuilder by Siteorigin plugin, and its widgets bundle. Intended for technically advanced users that build their own websites or websites for others, as a tool to make this process more efficient.
